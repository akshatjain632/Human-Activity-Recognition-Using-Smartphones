Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: A Comprehensive Study of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has emerged as a critical research area with applications spanning healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart home systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of recurrent neural network architectures for smartphone-based human activity recognition using the HAR dataset. We compare nine different models across three RNN families: Simple RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), each implemented with multiple architectural complexities and optimization techniques. The dataset comprises accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data from 30 subjects performing various activities. Our experimental results demonstrate that GRU-based architectures achieve superior performance, with the GRU-3 model attaining the highest accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 94.1%. This research contributes to the development of efficient HAR systems by providing insights into the effectiveness of different recurrent architectures and optimization strategies for temporal sensor data classification.
